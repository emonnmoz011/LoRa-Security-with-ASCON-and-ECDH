## Hardware Setup
1. **Wiring**:  
   - Connect LoRa RYLR896 modules to the ESP32 and Pico (ensure TX/RX, 3.3V, and GND are correctly connected).  
   - Refer to the pinout diagrams in the Documentation folder.

2. **Sensors**:  
   - **Temperature Sensor**: Connect via I2C (SDA & SCL) on the Pico.
   - **Pressure Sensor**: Utilize the code from `pico_art.py` with proper I2C configuration.

3. **Receiver**:  
   - Choose the appropriate receiver script based on your visualization needs (offline web, CSV logging, or Adafruit IO cloud).

---

## ECDH Key Exchange
1. Remove traditional DH implementation.
2. Import `x25519.py` into both transmitter and receiver scripts.
3. Refer to `ecdh.py` to:
   - Generate key pairs.
   - Exchange public keys via LoRa.
   - Compute the shared secret.
4. Derive encryption keys using the shared secret.

---

## Encryption Details
- **ASCON**:  
  - Lightweight and efficient encryption for IoT.
  - Encrypts sensor data with the key derived from ECDH.

- **AES-256**:  
  - Offers robust encryption for performance comparison.

---

## Data Visualization
1. **Offline Web Server**:  
   - Execute `rx_key_ex_ascon_offline_webpage.py` on the ESP32.
   - Connect to the Wi-Fi hotspot provided by the ESP32 and navigate to the given IP.

2. **Local CSV Storage**:  
   - Run `rx_key_ex_ascon_csv.py` to log sensor data into a CSV file stored on the ESP32.
   - Access the file via Thonny or similar tools.

3. **Adafruit IO Cloud**:  
   - Use `rx_key_ex_ascon_cloud.py` after configuring your Adafruit IO account and feed.
   - Ensure the ESP32 is connected to a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network for proper cloud integration.

---

## Hacker Mode
- **MITM Attack Simulation**:  
  - Duplicate receiver setup without key exchange/encryption.
  - Attempts to intercept data will fail without the correct keys.

- **Flooding Attack Simulation**:  
  - Rogue transmitter sends bogus LoRa messages.
  - The receiver only validates messages from authorized transmitters based on IDs and parameters.

---

## Performance Metrics
- **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**
- **RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)**
- **Latency**
- **Power Consumption**
- **Memory Usage**

---

## Conclusion
Integrating LoRa with NIST ASCON, AES-256, and ECDH provides a secure and cost-effective IoT communication system. The flexible design supports multiple data visualization methods and ensures robust security for modern IoT applications.
