Project Title: Secure LoRa-based IoT Communication with ASCON and AES-256, featuring ECDH Key Exchange and Data Visualization

Overview: This project explores secure and efficient long-range communication for IoT devices using LoRa technology. It incorporates the newly standardized NIST ASCON encryption, AES-256 encryption, and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange to ensure robust security. The system is designed to handle various sensor data and supports three data visualization methods: real-time updates on an offline web server, local CSV storage, and secure cloud storage on Adafruit IO. Performance comparisons show that ASCON outperforms AES-256 in terms of SNR, RSSI, latency, power consumption, and memory usage.

Hardware Setup:

Connect the LoRa RYLR896 module to the ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Pico as per the provided pinout diagrams. Pay attention to:

TX/RX pins

3.3V power supply

Ground connections

Any specific pins designated for your sensors

For the Temperature Sensor:

Use the I2C communication pins on the Pico (GPIO pins typically labeled SDA and SCL).

Implement the relevant code from rpi_uart_ascon.py or similar transmitter files.

For the Pressure Sensor (BMP280 or similar):

Replace the temperature sensorâ€™s I2C code with the code from pico_art.py, focusing on reading the pressure sensor data instead.

On the ESP32 side:

Use the receiver code that matches your chosen data visualization (offline web, CSV storage, or cloud).

If using the offline web server, connect to the Wi-Fi hotspot created by the ESP32 and visit the IP address shown in the console.

Key Exchange (Replacing DH with ECDH):

Delete or comment out the existing Diffie-Hellman (DH) code.

Import x25519.py into your main scripts (transmitter and receiver).

Refer to ecdh.py for a usage example:

Generate key pairs on both transmitter and receiver.

Exchange public keys over LoRa.

Derive the shared secret from the received public key.

Use the derived shared secret to strengthen the encryption keys for ASCON or AES-256.

Encryption Details:

ASCON:

This is the newly standardized lightweight AEAD cipher by NIST.

Integrate it into your transmitter and receiver code, ensuring you encrypt the sensor data before sending.

Decrypt on the receiver side using the shared secret from ECDH.

AES-256:

The more traditional encryption standard.

Use the derived key from ECDH for AES encryption if you want a fallback or comparative testing against ASCON.

Data Visualization:

Offline Web Server:

Use rx_key_ex_ascon_offline_webpage.py.

The ESP32 creates a hotspot and displays an IP address in the console.

Connect to this Wi-Fi on your computer or mobile device.

Enter the IP address in a web browser.

Refresh the page to view updated sensor readings (formatted by weather_station.html).

Local CSV Storage:

Use rx_key_ex_ascon_csv.py on the receiver.

Data is saved in a CSV file in the ESP32 file system.

Download the file using Thonny or a similar IDE to view historical data.

Adafruit IO Cloud:

Use rx_key_ex_ascon_cloud.py on the receiver.

Sign up for Adafruit IO (https://io.adafruit.com/).

Create a feed for your data.

Insert your Adafruit IO key, feed name, and username in the script.

Ensure the ESP32 is connected to a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network.

Data will appear on your Adafruit IO dashboard.

Hacker Mode (Optional):

MITM Attack:

Create a duplicate receiver without key exchange or encryption.

Attempt to intercept LoRa packets from the transmitter.

Demonstrates that without the encryption key, the data remains secure.

Flooding Attack:

Create a rogue transmitter that sends continuous bogus messages.

Attempt to overwhelm the legitimate receiver with spam.

The receiver only accepts packets from known addresses with the correct communication parameters and network ID, illustrating robust filtering.

Conclusion: This project demonstrates a secure, long-range IoT communication system using LoRa, ASCON, AES-256, and ECDH. It addresses modern IoT requirements by providing multi-layer security, cost-effectiveness, and flexible data visualization. The setup and code can be easily adapted for diverse environmental sensors and expanded to accommodate additional functionalities.
